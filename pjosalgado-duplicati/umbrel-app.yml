  Duplicati is a backup client that securely stores encrypted, incremental, compressed backups on local storage, cloud storage services and remote file servers.
  The Duplicati project was inspired by Duplicity and had similar functionality until 2008. In that year the storage model was redesigned completely and the program was rebuilt from scratch.

releaseNotes: >-
  After almost 2 years, a new Beta has taken its time, but it's finally there.
  It's a roll-up of all the fixes since the last beta build and is expected to cause very few issues when upgrading.
  This release is almost identical to Canary 106.
  It involves a better UI for dark mode, better support for Dropbox, Jottacloud, S3, Tencent backends, add IDrive backend, TLS modernization, bug fixes, upgrades to libraries.
  Points of attention: 
    database upgrade from 11 to 12: Downgrade from this version requires manually adjusting the version number in the database.
    The additions can be re-applied if the database is upgraded again later.
